The last week of the semester is dedicated to a Data Science Project.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will demonstrate the ability to:

- explain why data science is a critical emerging field and why computations are needed in this area;
- describe at least two algorithms commonly used in each of the four areas of data science covered in this course;
- compare the computational efficiency of algorithms;
- demonstrate the ability to write and debug simple programs in Python;
- illustrate numerical results of algorithms graphically and to interpret these results;
- analyze large sets of data using Python libraries.
