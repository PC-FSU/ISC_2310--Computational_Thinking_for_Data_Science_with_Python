So we have 5 sales reps so we need 5 random numbers. Once we have a random sales amount for each rep we use the table to compute the commission rate and then compute the total commission for each rep. We do this many, many times and then average the total commissions.\n",

However,the sales reps are good at what they do (based on their history) so they probably won't have very few sales. So for simplicity let's assume that no one has ever sold less than 85 percent of their target value. For simplicity, let's also assume that no one sells more than 110 percent of their target value. There is a more sophisticated way to do this by assuming a particular distribution (given by a pdf) but we will just take a uniform approach to generating the random numbers.\n",
