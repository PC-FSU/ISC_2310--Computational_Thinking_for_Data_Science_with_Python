So the first rectangle has sides given by the first element of list x and  the first element of list y; similarly for the second rectangle.  Calculate the area of the first rectangle and print out.  Then write a conditional which tests to see if the area is greater than 25.  If the area is greater than 25, use a formatted print statement to print out the fact that the area is >25 and the values of the sides.  If the area is <= 25, print out an appropriate statement along with values of x, y, and area. There are two rectangles so you could do a loop but here I just want you to access the correct element from the list (recall that this is done using square brackets).
