    "In this project we want to use the Greedy algorithm to solve a scheduling problem.  Assume that you have a summer internship where you work 8 hours per day.  Your supervisor has given you a list of 7 tasks to complete and has prioritized these by ranking them by 1 through 10, where 10 is the most important task.  You look at this list of tasks and estimate the time (in minutes) that you need to complete each one.  Unfortunately you can't complete all 7 tasks in 8 hours so the goal is to determine which tasks to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first assume that we use a Greedy Algorithm where we choose the task which has the highest priority to complete first.  When that is done we choose the task to do which has the next highest priority that can be completed in the remaining time, etc.  Your goal is to determine which tasks you can complete in the first 8 hour day.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is our strategy for writing this code to determine which tasks to do on the first day?\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, this is just like the Greedy algorithm for the Knapsack problem where instead of picking the item with the highest value not already in the Knapsack (and which fits), we pick the task which has the highest priority and which is not already completed and which can be done in the remaining time.  \n",
