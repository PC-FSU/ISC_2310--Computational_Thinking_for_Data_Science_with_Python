    "# Practice - Week 12 - Logistic Regression for a Set of Admission Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we want to use logistic regression as a 0/1 classifier on a synthetic set of data containing admission records. There are 100 data records with 3 columns.  The first column gives the student's score on an English exam (total possible is 65), the second the score on a math exam (total possible 95) and the third is the outcome.  The question we want to answer is \"Should a student with a given English and math score be admitted?\"  Thus if the outcome =1 (True) the student should be admitted and if outcome =0 (False) the student should not be admitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is contained in the file admit_data.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "* Import libraries and Logistic Regression function\n",
    "* Create dataframe from file admit_data.csv\n",
    "* Check feature names; you will see that some have spaces in them so redefine names without spaces to make things easier later\n",
    "* Create new column in dataframe called \"Admit\" with \"yes\" or \"no\" values and then plot math vs english scores with color indicating whether they were admitted using your new column\n",
    "* Create target array  and 2-D data array  \n",
    "* Split data into training and test sets using 75-25 split\n",
    "* Create  Logistic Regression model  and fit the training data; determine percent of accuracy\n",
    "* Determine accuracy of model on test data\n",
    "* Now we want to add a column to dataframe for plotting which gives predicted outcome for ALL data; to do this we first predict the outcome for the entire set X, put this in an array and then add the column to dataframe. Do NOT create the model again and fit all data rather use the model you already created.\n",
    "* Add column to dataframe with values \"yes\" or \"no\" for this prediction\n",
    "* Plot (as you did before) math vs english with color indicated by actual \"Admit\" and another plot with predicted results.  \n",
    "* Compare\n",
