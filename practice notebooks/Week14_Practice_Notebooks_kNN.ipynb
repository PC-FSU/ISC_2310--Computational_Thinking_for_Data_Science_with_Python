    "# Week 14 Practice Notebook - Using kNN for a Multi-class Classification Problem\n",

    "In this notebook we return to the iris dataset which we have used last week.  As before, we want to predict what variety of iris (setosa, versicolor or virginica) that a plant belongs to based on its petal and sepal length and width.  Because there are 3 possible outcomes it is a multi-class classification problem.\n",

    "* Create target array; you should already have   2-D data array which you used to create dataframe \n",
    "* Split data into training and test sets using 70-30 split\n",
    "* Scale data using scikit-learn StandardScaler (I have provided statements for this)\n",
    "* Add a loop to use kNN classifier for k=2 to 5 and test each model on the training data; pick the value of k which does the best on training data. \n",
    "* Create  kNN classifier with your value of k  and fit the training data; determine percent of accuracy for test data\n",
